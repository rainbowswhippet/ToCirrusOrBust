This week's task is to complete "The basics" on Linux Journey website and learn 30+ basic commands.

First lab completed:
- Open and use the terminal
- Use basic commands:
    - whoami
    - id
    - id root
    - echo
    - ctrl+c
- Install software (htop) using (sudo apt install)
- Monitor systems performance using (htop)

I was getting a feel for the (echo) command and ended up arguing with Labby (LabEx AI assistant). I input "Just getting started with Linux!" and the
terminal returned (dquote>) and it wouldn't get out of that command, basically broken. After much to-ing and fro-ing with Labby, because it was 
gaslighting me by saying "if you input exactly "Just getting started with Linux!" it works perfectly", well it wasn't - turns out the (!) broke the 
string and the terminal treated the quote mark after the (!) as opening a new quote. Inputting another (") after (dquote>), the terminal closed the quote. 
Or just use (ctrl+c) to get out of the command. Labby at the end said using single quotes for strings is best and the top users do this. Bastard.
