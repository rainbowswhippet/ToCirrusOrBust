An engineering journey from the ground up

AI is guiding me on what could be called a "near mid-life crisis career change" for the next 18 months, while working a full time job as an Interior Designer! 

Task 1 - set up this repo to document my learning. Tick.
Task 2 - install Ubuntu with a VM. I don't know why, but this took 1.5 hours, maybe because I'm a noob. I looked up a few websites on the best way to install, Youtube was extremely helpful here - found a video that instructed to install Ubuntu Server rather than Ubuntu Desktop using UTM VM. Tick.
