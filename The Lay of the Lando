P01M01W02D06 - Lab 01

Tasks
    Create a file named system_report.txt in your current directory (~/project).
    The file must contain the output of the whoami, uname -a (all system information), and uptime commands.

Requirements
    The final report file must be named system_report.txt.
    You must use output redirection operators (> and >>) to write the command outputs into the file.
    The file must be created in the ~/project directory.

My input
    whoami > system_report.txt
        uname -a >> system_report.txt
            uptime >> system_report.txt
                cat system_report.txt        
:)

Summary
    In this challenge, you practiced using several essential commands that every system administrator must master:
      whoami: To confirm your user identity on the Project Phoenix server.
      uname: To check operating system information and ensure compatibility.
      who: To see who else is working on the development server.
      id: To inspect your user and group memberships for proper access control.
      top: To monitor system processes and resource usage to ensure optimal performance.
      Output Redirection (> and >>): To document your findings in professional reports.
