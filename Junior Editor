Use (cat, head, tail) to view contents of the file

Tasks
  Use cat to view the contents of /home/labex/project/manuscript_v1.txt.
  Use head to view the first two lines of /home/labex/project/manuscript_v2.txt.
  Use tail to view the last line of both files.
Requirements
  Use only the commands learned in the File Contents and Comparing lab (cat, head, tail).
  Do not modify the contents of the files.

* I found out you can view two files at the same time - snap!!
  (cat) (-n1) (file1) (file2)
    File 1 name will display first with it's name with the content displayed on the next line.
    File 2 as above, but with an empty line before it for separation.
