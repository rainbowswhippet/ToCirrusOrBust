#User Management Challenge

Introduction
In this challenge, you will apply your knowledge of Linux user account management. You'll create new user accounts, modify existing ones, and delete users. This challenge will test your understanding of the concepts learned in the "User Account Management" lab.
Achievements
You'll demonstrate your ability to use:
useradd - to create new users
passwd - to change user passwords
usermod - to modify user accounts
userdel - to delete user accounts
This is a Challenge, which differs from a Guided Lab in that you need to try to complete the challenge task independently, rather than following the steps of a lab to learn. Challenges are usually a bit difficult. If you find it difficult, you can discuss with Labby or check the solution. Historical data shows that this is a beginner level challenge with a 94% pass rate. It has received a 99% positive review rate from learners.

Labby
Great! Let me prepare the lab VM for you. While it's being set up, you can start reviewing the first step of this lab.

Labby
Creating User Accounts
In this step, you'll create several user accounts with different specifications.
Tasks
Complete the following tasks in order:
Create a user named joker.
Create a user named batman with a home directory at /home/gotham.
Requirements
Use the useradd command for all user creations.
batman has a different home directory than the default.
Example
After completing these tasks, you can verify the user information like this:
sudo grep 'joker\|batman' /etc/passwd
Sample output:
joker:x:5001:5001::/home/joker:/bin/sh
batman:x:5002:5002::/home/gotham:/bin/sh
Continue

Labby
Inspect Result
Verify if joker user exists
Verify if batman user exists with correct home directory
Continue

Labby
Managing User Passwords
In this step, you'll set and change passwords for users.
Tasks
Complete the following tasks:
Set a password for the joker user.
Change the password for the batman user.
Requirements
Use the passwd command for all password operations.
For this challenge, use simple passwords like password123.
Example
After setting the passwords, you can check the password status:
sudo passwd -S joker
sudo passwd -S batman
 Explain Code
Sample output:
joker P 01/19/2024 0 99999 7 -1
batman P 01/19/2024 0 99999 7 -1
 Explain Code
/explain
```bash
sudo passwd -S joker
sudo passwd -S batman
```

Labby
Hello! I see you've already checked the status of the users with sudo passwd -S.
Based on your output, both joker and batman have a "P" status, which correctly indicates that they both have usable passwords.
If the verification is not passing, or if you haven't actually performed the requested tasks yet, here is a hint:
To set or change a password: You should use the passwd command followed by the username.
Example logic: sudo passwd <username>
Interaction: After running the command, the terminal will prompt you to enter the new password twice. For this challenge, you can use something simple like password123.
You can click the "Check" button to see the validation results. If you need a more detailed explanation or the full solution, consider upgrading to LabEx Pro!
Keep up the great work!

```plaintext
joker P 01/19/2024 0 99999 7 -1
batman P 01/19/2024 0 99999 7 -1
```

Labby
It looks like you've successfully verified the password status for both users!
The P in your output confirms that both joker and batman have active passwords set.
If you have already followed the instructions to:
Set the password for joker.
Change the password for batman.
Then you are all set! You can now click the "Check" button in the challenge interface to verify your progress and move on to the next step.
If the check fails, make sure you used sudo when setting the passwords to ensure the changes were saved correctly.
Keep it up! 🚀

Change the batman user's shell to /bin/bash.
Requirements
Use the usermod command for all modifications.
Example
After making these changes, you can verify them:
sudo grep 'joker\|batman' /etc/passwd
