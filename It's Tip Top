#Top

1. Basic usage of the top command to display system processes and resource usage.
    'q' to quit
    'h' or '?' while top is running to see a help screen with all available commands
2. How to sort processes by different criteria (CPU usage, memory usage, PID) within top.
    'M' key (uppercase), this will sort the processes by memory usage (resident set size) instead of CPU usage.
    'P' key (uppercase), to sort by CPU usage again
    'N' key (uppercase), to sort by process ID (PID)
    'R' (uppercase), to reverse the current sort order
3. Changing the update interval of top for more or less frequent updates.
    top -d 1
        where 1 is the update delay
        very short update intervals can themselves consume significant CPU resources, so use them judiciously
4 Monitoring processes for a specific user
    top -u labex
        where labex is the username
5. Displaying only active processes, filtering out idle ones
    top -i
        filters out any process that has zero CPU usage since the last update

Additional top command options and interactive commands:
-b: Run in batch mode (useful for sending output to other programs or files)
-n: Number of iterations before top will terminate
'k': Kill a process (by PID) from within top
'r': Renice (change priority of) a process
'c': Toggle display of command name/line
'V': Display version information
