Task 1 - set up this repo to document my learning. Tick. 

Task 2 - install Ubuntu with a VM. I don't know why, but this took 1.5 hours, maybe because I'm a noob. 
I looked up a few websites on the best way to install, Youtube was extremely helpful here - found a video 
that instructed to install Ubuntu Server rather than Ubuntu Desktop using UTM VM. Tick.
